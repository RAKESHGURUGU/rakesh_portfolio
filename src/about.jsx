              Hi, I'm Rakesh, a passionate Computer Science student currently pursuing my B.Tech in CSE at GMRIT. I'm deeply interested in Data Structures & Algorithms and Fullstack Development, where I enjoy building efficient solutions and creating impactful applications.
              I had the opportunity to do an apprenticeship at ThoughtWorks Hyderabad (MNC), which gave me real-world exposure to professional software development practices and strengthened my problem-solving and teamwork skills.
              Apart from academics, I'm actively involved in technical communities like ACM, where I contribute to peer learning and leadership initiatives.
              My goal is to continuously learn, innovate, and contribute to meaningful projects that bridge creativity and technology.
